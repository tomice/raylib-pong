# Raylib Pong

The following is just a simple version of Pong written in C for learning
purposes to test out Raylib. Also written using Visual Studio 2022 on a Windows
machine which is not my normal programming environment. For fun.

## Requirements

Some modern-ish C compiler, cmake, ability to download, etc.

Pre-built binaries coming soon. Maybe. For now, you'll need to build from source.

## Usage

Build using `cmake` and run. Further info TBD.

## Controls

Player 1 is controlled with W and S keys. Player 2 is controlled with Up and Down keys.

## Author

Game and music written by Tom Ice.

## License

This is under the MIT License. See actual license file for more information.

## Credits

Wouldn't be possible without Raylib. More info here: <https://www.raylib.com/>
